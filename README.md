# Trajectory Visualising #

## overview

This is the work done by me and my partner ***Jeremy Swanson***  Email: Jeremy.Swanson@nicta.com.au at our intern at Data61 over the summer of 2015-2016 under supervior of Dr ***Jianlong Zhou*** Email: Jianlong.Zhou@nicta.com.au.

I contains some python scripts and some java libraries for the purpose of analysing trajectory data using machine learning, and then visualising those results.


## Data
The data we're using is the VAST 2015 challenge data(http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2015) The main data files are too big to include in the repo, so aren't included.
