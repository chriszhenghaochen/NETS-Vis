# Trajectory Visualising #

## overview
NEsTS-Vis is a ***Neural Net System of Time Time-Spatial Visualization***

It contains some python scripts and some java libraries for the purpose of analysing trajectory data using machine learning, and then visualising those results.

The main algorithm of it are ***Self-Organizing Map*** and ***Recurrent Neural Net***, the front end of system contain Heat Map, Dynamic Time Warping, 3D cube and other Visualization Tools
