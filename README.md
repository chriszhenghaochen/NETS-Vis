# NeST-Vis #

## overview
NeST-Vis is a ***Neural Net based Framework of Time-Spatial Visualization***

* The main algorithms of it are ***Self-Organizing Map*** and ***Recurrent Neural Net***,

* the front end of front-end contain Heat Map, Dynamic Time Warping, 3D cube and other Visualization Tools

* The data base used for this is ***Neo4j***

## Data
* VAST 2015 challenge data(http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2015)
* Mobile Phone Connection Data in China


## Document

* In each folder, there is readme for user as well as presentation slide with me and Jeremy
* I will update the Published paper soon
